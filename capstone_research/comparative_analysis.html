      <p>
        This puzzle game is made purely in js and has a similar scope to
        something I'd want to make. I like the idea/gameplay of the game but the
        UX is a bit lacking. Dragging the wire around isn't fluid enough for my
        liking, sometimes the wire gets stuck. Also, it's a bit confusing what
        the red circles do, so it could benefit from some better directions.

      <p>
        This game was made in a game jam, where you had 2 weeks to come up with
        a js game given a specific theme. This person chose to make pinball
        using dead fish as balls, since the theme was "raw". I like the graphics
        in this game, they fit with theme quite nicely. I wish the gameplay was
        a bit more interesting though, as this one image captures essentially
        the whole game. The physics simulations are quite nice and seem
        realistic.
