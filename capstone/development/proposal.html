          My topic is a bunch of minigames for each section of the seal, where
          is game is related to some aspect of the section. People of any age
          would be able to play the games, but the primary audience would be
          adults.

          The main page of this project would be a picture of the seal where
          each section is clickable and leads to a different game. The games
          would cover many genres like simulation, farming, and puzzle. Also
          there would be a leaderboard for the games that have scores which can
          be stored on a backend.

          I am worried that this will take a lot of time to make, especially if
          some of the games end up a lot more complex than expected. Also, the
          graphics part of the games could be very challenging to make, so the
          final result may involve a lot of stick figures and plain boxes.
