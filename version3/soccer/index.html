        Welcome! Use the "w" and "s" keys to control the left player and the up
        and down arrow keys to control the right player. This section of the
        seal showcases children playing soccer and otherwise enjoying
        themselves. Davis has had made many efforts to provide a safe and fun
        environment for children to play in. However, unfortunately not all
        children have had the same opportunities to play. Several groups of
        children have been unable to live a carefree childhood due to
        unfortunate circumstances. Click
