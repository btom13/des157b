    &emsp; &emsp; One of the main observation that seemed to be significant throughout our showcase section between
    multiple groups is that our overall styling can be improved for better user experience. Currently, we only used
    basic colors for the backgrounds and plain fonts for the interfaces. Another crucial feedback we gained was that 
    although our game was fun and engaging, it lacked the "educational" component. This, my teamate and I, will
    for sure implement as we continue to work on our design. Lastly, we also gained some feedback regarding the other
    sections of the seal that we have yet to implement. For the "Monopoly board game", we could implement a "Did you know"
    panels for each of the pins on the map depicting what the region is about. For the soccer game, we can also implement
    a "Fun Fact" section everytime someone scores to make it more "educational". <br> 
    &emsp; &emsp; For the UI aesthetics, I really want to use "aesthetic" colors such as beige to make the website more
    "smooth" and "clean" looking. Therefore, with the combination of some coloring rework as well as organizing the sections
    in a way that is aesthetically pleasing, the site would look way more presentable. I also want to blur the background of
    the seal when I hover a specific section so the audience can focus easier on that section. For the educational part,
    I am hoping to implement a quiz game that asks the user questions related to the city of Davis and its history. This 
    way, audience can be more familiar with the city itself.
